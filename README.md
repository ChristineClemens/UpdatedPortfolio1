# Updated Portfolio (Version 2)
# Homework02
Christine Clemens - Second Homework Submission for SCS Coding Bootcamp

### Objective:
   To develop a responsive portfolio website that included an "About", "Portfolio", and "Contact" webpage along with my personalized information. Likewise, this project was an opportunity for me to apply the HTML5, CSS3 styling, Bootstrap scaffolding, and typography know-how developed this week in class. The ultimate goal of this website will be to update it intermittently throughout the course of Bootcamp to apply new knowledge, ultimately resulting in a fully developed user-friendly portfolio website.     

### For this assignment, I was required to:
* Use Bootstrap to develop a stylized portfolio website
* Include a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images
* Organize image files and stylesheets in an assets folder
* Assign appropriate class values to elements to ensure margins in viewports larger than 576px
* Ensure consistency of the navbar, footer, and stylistic elements on each webpage

### I was required to include:
* An index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html, style.css, and README.md file
* A navbar that is consistent across all files
* A responsive layout and responsive images
* A Bootstrap grid system that employed containers, rows, and columns
* Functioning navigation links to both local and external pages
* Minimal use of media queries to ensure appropriate responses
* Semantic HTML tags
* Personalized information
* Bootstrap components

### Additionally, I was encouraged to:
* A sticky footer, sub-rows, and sub-columns using Bootstrap documentation

*I did not include personalized information at this time as I did not feel comfortable including too many of my personal details; however, I did employ lorem ipsum text in its place so that I am able to add this information at a later time.
